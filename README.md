# Store Project - React

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

** SUMMARY **

The Front-End implementation of the E-Commerce type of store made with React. 
Created with the purpose of giving it's users the ability to search, add to wish list/cart, rate and buy desired products, ranging from clothing to jewelry.
The Back-End consists in Java Spring Boot and provides two roles: User and Admin. While unlogged, you can do all the same things as a User logged account can do, except rating a product. While logged in an Admin account, you can add, update and delete products, view the users list and add a user
It also as some filters 

Made use of login/register endpoints of the Java Springboot API (previously built) also with search filters to order (ascending/descending) products by rating, category and number of products per page. Also used fully functional pagination, aswell as other miscellaneous.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
